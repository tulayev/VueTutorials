(Yes, I know, that was its parent series Inu Yasha. Indulge me.) While it'd be a bit of a stretch to say that these are good episodes, they do have some legitimate folkloric roots – not necessarily Japan-specific roots, but still. The most obvious for most viewers is that the Sea Snake Demon's story is very much of a piece with Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, with a healthy dose of the Medusa myth thrown in for fun.",
